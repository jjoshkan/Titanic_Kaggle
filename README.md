Kaggle Competition (Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster)

Code to Kaggle Competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster".
Our task is to classify the survival of a person based on the information (Feature) in the datasets.

This is a good Supervised Machine Learning problem where you can tinker around with the feature and make a prediction using different models

Made a pipeline focusing on Random Forest Classifier algorithm to classify the survival outcome.
